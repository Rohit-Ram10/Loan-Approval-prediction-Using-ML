# Loan-Approval-prediction-Using-ML

This project focuses on predicting loan approval status using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes applicant demographic and financial details, which are analyzed and modeled to assist in financial risk assessment.

🔑 Key Features

Performed data preprocessing: handled missing values, applied log transformations, and encoded categorical variables.

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations to identify patterns in loan approval trends.

Implemented and compared machine learning models such as Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Applied feature scaling and model evaluation to optimize prediction accuracy.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (Random Forest, SVM, preprocessing, evaluation)

📈 Outcome

Achieved a reliable prediction model that can assist financial institutions in making informed loan approval decisions.
